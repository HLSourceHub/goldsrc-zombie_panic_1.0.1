----------|Tips & Notes|----------------------

This is an objective map for ZP. Meaning that
the only way for the humans to win is to escape
The Zombie Lives for this map is suppost to be
at least 1000. The humans will have to use
teamwork to get through the exit doors. And
The final Door will require at least 2 humans
to escape. But more might help in protecting
the escaping humans.

Also if one human reaches the exit, then human
side wins!

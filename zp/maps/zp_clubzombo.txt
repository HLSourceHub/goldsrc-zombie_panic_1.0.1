Story:
Durring a closed party at the famous "Club Zombo" one of the part guests attempted to bite one of the VIP members. Obviously, one of the Bouncers restrained the person, and threw him outside. However, when he landed his bones were heard breaking, and his head shattered on the pavement. It then proceeded to stand back up and lurch towards the very same  bouncer that threw him out. Having no other choice, the bouncer aimed and shot the thing in the head three times.

Some time later, hordes of creatures alike the one that was killed earlier jumped the fence and began knocking on the doors, trying to get in. The club's secret stash of weapons was opened much to the dismay of the club owner Cameron Cole. Weapons were passed out to everyone of all ages, and so they try to survive against the horde of creatures they call... Zombies.

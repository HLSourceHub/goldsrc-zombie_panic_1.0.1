***Escape from the Quad17 Complex!***
Due to the zombie presence, Quad17 is in tight lockdown. You must press six buttons to deactivate the security doors.
These security buttons are scattered throughout the Complex, and must be pressed in order from 1 to 6. Each button will open 1 door.
Once all security doors have been opened, at least one Survivor must escape to warn the outside world for the Survivor team to win.
